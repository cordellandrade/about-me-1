            <p>Hello, my name is Shelby Harner! I am a Seattle area native and can't imagine living anywhere else. The Pacific Northwest is always beautiful, but the summers are really what keep me here. I love to travel, but currently that has been put on hold, so I have been diving back into my love of crafts. During quarantine, I have been knitting, cross stitching, sewing masks and recently figured out how to make mask chains. What I am most proud of from my time at home is my new found green thumb with several house plants.</p>
